## Using

~~~
wp import <file>... --authors=<authors> [--skip=<data-type>]
~~~

Provides a command line interface to the WordPress Importer plugin, for
performing data migrations.

**OPTIONS**

	<file>...
		Path to one or more valid WXR files for importing. Directories are also accepted.

	--authors=<authors>
		How the author mapping should be handled. Options are 'create', 'mapping.csv', or 'skip'. The first will create any non-existent users from the WXR file. The second will read author mapping associations from a CSV, or create a CSV for editing if the file path doesn't exist. The CSV requires two columns, and a header row like "old_user_login,new_user_login". The last option will skip any author mapping.

	[--skip=<data-type>]
		Skip importing specific data. Supported options are: 'attachment' and 'image_resize' (skip time-consuming thumbnail generation).

**EXAMPLES**

    # Import content from a WXR file
    $ wp import example.wordpress.2016-06-21.xml --authors=create
    Starting the import process...
    Processing post #1 ("Hello world!") (post_type: post)
    -- 1 of 1
    -- Tue, 21 Jun 2016 05:31:12 +0000
    -- Imported post as post_id #1
    Success: Finished importing from 'example.wordpress.2016-06-21.xml' file.
